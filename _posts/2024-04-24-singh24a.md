title: 'EG-SIF: Improving Appearance Based Gaze Estimation using Self Improving Features'
abstract: Accurate gaze estimation is integral to a myriad of applications, from augmented
  reality to non-verbal communication analysis. However, the performance of gaze estimation
  models is often compromised by adverse conditions such as poor lighting, artifacts,
  low-resolution imagery, etc. To counter these challenges, we introduce the eye gaze
  estimation with self- improving features (EG-SIF) method, a novel approach that
  enhances model robustness and performance in suboptimal conditions. The EG-SIF method
  innovatively segregates eye images by quality, synthesizing pairs of high-quality
  and corresponding degraded images. It leverages a multitask training paradigm that
  emphasizes image enhancement through reconstruction from impaired versions. This
  strategy is not only pioneering in the realm of data segregation based on image
  quality but also introduces a transformative multitask framework that integrates
  image enhancement as an auxiliary task. We implement adaptive binning and mixed
  regression with intermediate supervision to refine capability of our model further.
  Empirical evidence demonstrates that our EG-SIF method significantly reduces the
  angular error in gaze estimation on challenging datasets such as MPIIGaze, improving
  from 4.64◦ to 4.53◦, and on RTGene, from 7.44◦ to 7.41◦, thereby setting a new benchmark
  in the field. Our contributions lay the foundation for future eye appearance based
  gaze estimation models that can operate reliably despite the presence of image quality
  adversities.
