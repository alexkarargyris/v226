title: 'StatTexNet: Evaluating the Importance of Statistical Parameters for Pyramid-Based
  Texture and Peripheral Vision Models'
abstract: Peripheral vision plays an important role in human vision, directing where
  and when to make saccades. Although human behavior in the periphery is well-predicted
  by pyramid- based texture models, these approaches rely on hand-picked image statistics
  that are still insufficient to capture a wide variety of textures. To develop a
  more principled approach to statistic selection for texture-based models of peripheral
  vision, we develop a self-supervised machine learning model to determine what set
  of statistics are most important for repre- senting texture. Our model, which we
  call StatTexNet, uses contrastive learning to take a large set of statistics and
  compress them to a smaller set that best represents texture fami- lies. We validate
  our method using depleted texture images where the constituent statistics are already
  known. We then use StatTexNet to determine the most and least important statistics
  for natural (non-depleted) texture images using weight interpretability metrics,
  finding these to be consistent with previous psychophysical studies. Finally, we
  demonstrate that textures are most effectively synthesized with the statistics identified
  as important; we see noticeable deterioration when excluding the most important
  statistics, but minimal effects when excluding least important. Overall, we develop
  a machine learning method of selecting statistics that can be used to create better
  peripheral vision models. With these better models, we can more effectively understand
  the effects of peripheral vision in human gaze.
