title: An Attention-based Predictive Agent for Handwritten Numeral/Alphabet Recognition
  via Generation
abstract: A number of attention-based models for either classification or generation
  of handwritten numerals/alphabets have been reported in the literature. However,
  generation and classification are done jointly in very few end-to-end models. We
  propose a predictive agent model that actively samples its visual environment via
  a sequence of glimpses. The attention is driven by the agentâ€™s sensory prediction
  (or generation) error. At each sampling instant, the model predicts the observation
  class and completes the partial sequence observed till that instant. It learns where
  and what to sample by jointly minimizing the classification and generation errors.
  Three variants of this model are evaluated for handwriting generation and recognition
  on images of handwritten numerals and alphabets from benchmark datasets. We show
  that the proposed model is more efficient in handwritten numeral/alphabet recognition
  than human participants in a recently published study as well as a highly-cited
  attention-based reinforcement model. This is the first known attention-based agent
  to interact with and learn end-to-end from images for recognition via generation,
  with high degree of accuracy and efficiency.
