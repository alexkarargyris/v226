title: Crafting Good Views of Medical Images for Contrastive Learning via Expert-level
  Visual Attention
abstract: Recent advancements in contrastive learning methods have shown significant
  improvements, which focus on minimizing the distances between different views of
  the same image. These methods typically craft two randomly augmented views of the
  same image as a positive pair, expecting the model to capture the inherent representation
  of the image. However, random data augmentation might not fully preserve image semantic
  information and can lead to a decline in the quality of the augmented views, thereby
  affecting the effectiveness of contrastive learning. This issue is particularly
  pronounced in the domain of medical images, where lesion areas can be subtle and
  are susceptible to distortion or removal. To address this issue, we leverage insights
  from radiologists’ expertise in diagnosing medical images and propose Gaze-Conditioned
  Augmentation (GCA) to craft high-quality contrastive views of medical images given
  the radiologist’s visual attention. Specifically, we track the gaze movements of
  radiologists and model their visual attention when reading to diagnose X-ray images.
  The learned model can predict visual attention of the radiologist when presented
  with a new X-ray image, and further guide the attention-aware augmentation, ensuring
  that it pays special attention to preserving disease-related abnormalities. Our
  proposed GCA can significantly improve the performance of contrastive learning methods
  on knee X-ray images, revealing its potential in medical applications.
