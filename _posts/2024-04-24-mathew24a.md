title: Leveraging Multi-Modal Saliency and Fusion for Gaze Target Detection
abstract: Gaze target detection (GTD) is the task of predicting where a person in
  an image is looking. This is a challenging task, as it requires the ability to understand
  the relationship between the personâ€™s head, body, and eyes, as well as the surrounding
  environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method for GTD that fuses multiple
  pieces of information extracted from an image. First, we project the 2D image into
  a 3D representation using monocular depth estimation. We then extract a depth-infused
  saliency module map, which highlights the most salient (attention - grabbing) regions
  in image for the subject in consideration. We also extract face and depth modalities
  from the image, and finally fuse all the extracted modalities to identify the gaze
  target. We quantitatively evaluated our method, including the ablation analysis
  on three publicly available datasets, namely VideoAttentionTarget, GazeFollow and
  GOO-Real, and showed that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. This suggests
  that our method is a promising new approach for GTD.
