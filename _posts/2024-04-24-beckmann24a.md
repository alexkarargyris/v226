title: 'SAM meets Gaze: Passive Eye Tracking for Prompt-based Instance Segmentation'
abstract: The annotation of large new datasets for machine learning is a very time-consuming
  and expensive process. This is particularly true for pixel-accurate labelling of
  e.g. segmentation masks. Prompt-based methods have been developed to accelerate
  this label generation process by allowing the model to incorporate additional clues
  from other sources such as humans. The recently published Segment Anything foundation
  model (SAM) extends this approach by providing a flexible framework with a model
  that was trained on more than 1 billion segmentation masks, while also being able
  to exploit explicit user input. In this paper, we explore the usage of a passive
  eye tracking system to collect gaze data during unconstrained image inspections
  which we integrate as a novel prompt input for SAM. We evaluated our method on the
  original SAM model and finetuned the prompt encoder and mask decoder for different
  gaze-based inputs, namely fixation points, blurred gaze maps and multiple heatmap
  variants. Our results indicate that the acquisition of gaze data is faster than
  other prompt-based approaches while the segmentation performance stays comparable
  to the state-of-the-art performance of SAM. Code is available at https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/cvmls/sam_meets_gaze.
