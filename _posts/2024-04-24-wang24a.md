title: 'GazeSAM: Interactive Image Segmentation with Eye Gaze and Segment Anything
  Model'
abstract: Interactive image segmentation aims to assist users in efficiently generating
  high-quality data annotations through user-friendly interactions such as clicking,
  scribbling, and bounding boxes. However, mouse-based interaction methods can induce
  user fatigue during large-scale dataset annotation and are not entirely suitable
  for some domains, such as radiology. This study introduces eye gaze as a novel interactive
  prompt for image segmentation, different than previous model-based applications.
  Specifically, leveraging the real-time interactive prompting feature of the recently
  proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM), we present the GazeSAM system to enable users
  to collect target segmentation masks by simply looking at the region of interest.
  GazeSAM tracks usersâ€™ eye gaze and utilizes it as the input prompt for SAM, generating
  target segmentation masks in real time. To our best knowledge, GazeSAM is the first
  work to combine eye gaze and SAM for interactive image segmentation. Experimental
  results demonstrate that GazeSAM can improve nearly 50% efficiency in 2D natural
  image and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The code is available in https://github.com/ukaukaaaa/GazeSAM.
