title: Exploring Foveation and Saccade for Improved Weakly-Supervised Localization
abstract: 'Deep neural networks have become the de facto choice as feature extraction
  engines, ubiquitously used for computer vision tasks. The current approach is to
  process every input with uniform resolution in a one-shot manner and make all of
  the predictions at once. However, human vision is an "active" process that not only
  actively switches from one focus point to another within the visual field, but also
  applies spatially varying attention centered at such focus points. To bridge the
  gap, we propose incorporating the bio-plausible mechanisms of foveation and saccades
  to build an active object localization framework. While foveation enables it to
  process different regions of the input with variable degrees of detail, saccades
  allow it to change the focus point of such foveated regions. Our experiments show
  that these mechanisms improve the quality of predicted bounding boxes by capturing
  all the essential object parts while minimizing unnecessary background clutter.
  Additionally, they enable the resiliency of the method by allowing it to detect
  multiple objects while being trained only on data containing a single object per
  image. Finally, we explore the alignment of our method with human perception using
  the interesting "duck-rabbit" optical illusion. The code is available at: https://github.com/TimurIbrayev/FALcon.'
