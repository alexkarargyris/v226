title: Interaction-aware Dynamic 3D Gaze Estimation in Videos
abstract: Human gaze in in-the-wild and outdoor human activities is a continuous and
  dynamic process that is driven by the anatomical eye movements such as fixations,
  saccades and smooth pursuit. However, learning gaze dynamics in videos remains as
  a challenging task as annotating human gaze in videos is labor-expensive. In this
  paper, we propose a novel method for dynamic 3D gaze estimation in videos by utilizing
  the human interaction labels. Our model contains a temporal gaze estimator which
  is built upon Autoregressive Transformer structures. Besides, our model learns the
  spatial relationship of gaze among multiple subjects, by constructing a Human Interaction
  Graph from predicted gaze and update the gaze feature with a structure-aware Transformer.
  Our model predict future gaze conditioned on historical gaze and the gaze interactions
  in an autoregressive manner. We propose a multi-state training algorithm to alternately
  update the Interaction module and dynamic gaze estimation module, when training
  on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled sequences. We show significant improvements
  in both within-domain gaze estimation accuracy and cross-domain generalization on
  the physically-unconstrained gaze estimation benchmark.
