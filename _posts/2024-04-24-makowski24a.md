title: Detection of Drowsiness and Impending Microsleep from Eye Movements
abstract: 'Drowsiness is a contributing factor in an estimated 12% of all road traffic
  fatalities. It is known that drowsiness directly affects oculomotor control. We
  therefore investigate whether drowsiness can be detected based on eye movements.
  To this end, we develop deep neural sequence models that exploit a person’s raw
  eye-gaze and eye-closure signals to detect drowsiness. We explore three measures
  of drowsiness ground truth: a widely-used sleepiness self-assessment, reaction time,
  and impending microsleep in the near future. We find that our sequence models are
  able to detect drowsiness and outperform a baseline processing established engineered
  features. We also find that the risk of a microsleep event in the near future can
  be predicted more accurately than the sleepiness self-assessment or the reaction
  time. Moreover, a model that has been trained on predicting microsleep also excels
  at predicting self-assessed sleepiness in a cross-task evaluation, which indicates
  that upcoming microsleep is a less noisy proxy of the drowsiness ground truth. We
  investigate the relative contribution of eye-closure and gaze information to the
  model’s performance. In order to make the topic of drowsiness detection more accessible
  to the research community, we collect and share eye-gaze data with participants
  in baseline and sleep-deprived states.'
