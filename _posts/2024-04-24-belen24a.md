title: Temporal Understanding of Gaze Communication with GazeTransformer
abstract: Gaze plays a crucial role in daily social interactions as it allows humans
  to communicate intentions effectively. We address the problem of temporal understanding
  of gaze communication in social videos in two stages. First, we develop GazeTransformer,
  an end-to-end module that infers atomic-level behaviours in a given frame. Second,
  we develop a temporal module that predicts event-level behaviours in a video using
  the inferred atomic-level behaviours. Compared to existing methods, GazeTransformer
  does not require human head and object locations as input. Instead, it identifies
  these locations in a parallel and end-to-end manner. In addition, it can predict
  the attended targets of all predicted humans and infer more atomic-level behaviours
  that cannot be handled simultaneously by previous approaches. We achieve promising
  performance on both atomic- and event-level prediction on the (M)VACATION dataset.
