title: Human-like multiple object tracking through occlusion via gaze-following
abstract: 'State-of-the art multiple object tracking (MOT) models have recently been
  shown to behave in qualitatively different ways from human observers. They exhibit
  superhuman performance for large numbers of targets and subhuman performance when
  targets disappear behind occluders. Here we investigate whether human gaze behavior
  can help explain differences in human and model behavior. Human subjects watched
  scenes with objects of various appearances. They tracked a designated subset of
  the objects, which moved continuously and frequently disappeared behind static black-bar
  occluders, reporting the designated objects at the end of each trial. We measured
  eye movements during tracking and tracking accuracy. We found that human gaze behavior
  is clearly guided by task-relevance: designated objects were preferentially fixated.
  We compared human performance to that of cognitive models inspired by state-of-the
  art MOT models with object slots, where each slot represents modelâ€™s probabilistic
  belief about the location and appearance of one object. In our model, incoming observations
  are unambiguously assigned to slots using the Hungarian algorithm. Locations are
  tracked probabilistically (given the hard assignment) with one Kalman filter per
  slot. We equipped the computational models with a fovea, yielding high-precision
  observations at the center and low-precision observations in the periphery. We found
  that constraining models to follow the same gaze behavior as humans (imposing the
  human measured fixation sequences) yields best captures human behavioral phenomena.
  These results demonstrate the importance of gaze behavior, allowing the human visual
  system to optimally use its limited resources.'
