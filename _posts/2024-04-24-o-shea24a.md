title: 'SuperVision: Self-Supervised Super-Resolution for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation'
abstract: Gaze estimation is a valuable tool with a broad range of applications in
  various fields, including medicine, psychology, virtual reality, marketing, and
  safety. Therefore, it is essential to have gaze estimation software that is cost-efficient
  and high-performing. Accurately predicting gaze remains a difficult task, particularly
  in real-world situations where images are affected by motion blur, video compression,
  and noise. Super-resolution (SR) has been shown to remove these degradations and
  improve image quality from a visual perspective. This work examines the usefulness
  of super-resolution for improving appearance-based gaze estimation and demonstrates
  that not all SR models preserve the gaze direction. We propose a two-step framework
  for gaze estimation based on the SwinIR super-resolution model. The proposed method
  consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, particularly in scenarios involving
  low-resolution or degraded images. Furthermore, we examine the use of super-resolution
  through the lens of self-supervised learning for gaze estimation and propose a novel
  architecture “SuperVision” by fusing an SR backbone network to a ResNet18. While
  only using 20% of the data, the proposed SuperVision architecture outperforms the
  state-of-the-art GazeTR method by 15.5%.
